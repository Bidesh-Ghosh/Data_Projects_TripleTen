# Age Verfication

## Overview

* The purpose of this project is to develop a computer vision model that can assist a grocery store in automatically verifying if a customer is of legal age to purchase alcohol based on an image of their face.

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn] (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [tensorflow] (https://www.tensorflow.org/)

### Functionality

* Completes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical data analysis.
* Datasets consists of a csv file that includes filenames and actual ages and image files that are labled with filenames correlating to images of faces.
* This project uses TensorFlow tools to analyze/validate/test a model that can predict a customers age based off an image of their face.
* The model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 6.5182.
