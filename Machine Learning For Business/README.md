# Machine Learning for Business

## Overview

* The purpose of this project is to determine the best place to drill a new oil well given oil well parameters in 3 separate regions.

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Functionality

* Collects the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves.
* Builds a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells.
* Picks the oil wells with the highest estimated values.
* The region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells was Region 2.
