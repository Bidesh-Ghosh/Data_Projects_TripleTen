# Sweet Lift Taxi Company

## Overview

* The purpose of this project is to analyze historical user data for a taxi company in order to create a model that can predict the number of drivers needed in the next hour.

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [lightgbm](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [catboost](https://catboost.ai/)

### Functionality

* Completes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical data analysis.
* The models that are tested are LinearRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestRegressor, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
* RandomForestRegressor achieved the best score with an RMSE of 47.22 with the test dataset. Sweet lift Taxi Company should use this model to determine how many drivers they should hire for a particular time.
