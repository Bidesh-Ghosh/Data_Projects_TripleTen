The following conclusions were made from this study:

* In Springfield the number of songs played peaks on Mondays and Fridays, while on Wednesday there is a decrease in activity.
* In Shelbyville, the users listen to music more on Wednesday. User activity on Monday and Friday is lower.
* Users from Springfield and Shelbyville listen to similar music. The top five genres are the same, only rock and electronic have switched places.
* In Springfield, the number of missing values turned out to be so big that the value 'unknown' came in 10th. This means that missing values make up a considerable portion of the data, which may be a basis for questioning the reliability of our conclusions.
* Pop music is the most popular genre in Springfield
* Pop music turned out to be equally popular in Springfield and Shelbyville. Rap was not in the top 5 for either city.
