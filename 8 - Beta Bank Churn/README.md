# Beta Bank Churn

## Overview

* The purpose of this project is to optimize a model that can predict if a customer will leave Beta Bank. The data will be preprocessed and then several different models will be tested along with several optimization techniques in order to produce a model with an F1 score of 0.59 or above

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

### Functionality

* Completes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical data analysis.
* LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier ML algorithms were employed to predict whether a customer will leave Beta Bank.
* DecisionTreeClassifier with max_depth = 5 produced a model that achieved an F1 score of 0.604 and an AUC-ROC of 0.828.
